""" Methods and classes to manipulate the balena host systemd via dbus

The methods used here are the systemd pid1 dbus management interface described
at https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/dbus/

These methods are used to do things like unmount the inactive sysroot so we can
write to its block device without trashing everything.
